# handlers/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'handlers' directory a Python package.

# The unified flow logic is contained within handlers.step_1.py.
# start_bot.py imports directly from handlers.step_1.
# This __init__.py should be empty or contain only comments to ensure
# it does not interfere with imports or cause circular dependencies.
# CRITICAL: Ensure no 'from .step_2 import ...' or similar obsolete imports remain.
