# handlers/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'handlers' directory a Python package.

# With the unified flow in z1_flow_handler.py, start_bot.py should
# directly import necessary functions and constants from there, e.g.:
# from handlers.z1_flow_handler import start_z1_gray_unified_flow, handle_unlock_repair_callback_unified, CALLBACK_UNLOCK_REPAIR_49_UNIFIED

# Therefore, this __init__.py likely does not need to re-export anything
# from the old step_1, step_2, or step_3 modules if they are no longer directly used
# by start_bot.py or other external modules.

# If there were any truly package-level constants or utilities within the 'handlers'
# package itself (not in submodules), they could be defined or imported here.
# For now, keeping it minimal to avoid accidental imports of obsolete code.

# If you had a very specific reason to re-export something from z1_flow_handler
# at the package level (e.g., to allow `from handlers import CALLBACK_...`),
# you could do:
# from .z1_flow_handler import CALLBACK_UNLOCK_REPAIR_49_UNIFIED
# __all__ = ['CALLBACK_UNLOCK_REPAIR_49_UNIFIED']
# However, direct imports (from handlers.z1_flow_handler) are often clearer.

# For now, to resolve the circular import issue and reflect the unified flow,
# ensure no imports from the old step_2.py (or step_3.py if also obsolete) exist here.
# The error specifically mentioned `from .step_2 import CALLBACK_S3_VIEW_DIAGNOSIS`.
# This line MUST be removed.

# Based on the error, the problematic line was:
# from .step_2 import CALLBACK_S3_VIEW_DIAGNOSIS # REMOVE THIS LINE

# If this file contained other imports from .step_1, .step_3 etc.,
# that are no longer relevant due to the unified flow, remove them too.
# Given the traceback, it seems the only problematic one causing the circular import
# in this specific path was the one from .step_2.

# A clean __init__.py for the current unified structure could simply be:
# (empty or just a comment)
